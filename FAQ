*** GNU Xnee FAQ *** 

   (this file was generated from the complete GNU Xnee Manual)


`Where do I send questions?'
     <info-xnee@gnu.org>
`Where and how do I report bugs?'
     Turn on verbose mode `cnee --verbose' and save the printouts.
     Include all printouts and log files in the mail which is sent to
     <xnee-bug@gnu.org>
`When setting ranges (integers), how do I know what numbers belong'
     to X11 data?  You can either type the data name directly (e.g
     MotionNotify) or you can use the print-xxx-name options.
        * `--print-data-name'

        * `--print-event-name'

        * `--print-error-name'

        * `--print-reply-name'

        * `--print-request-name'

`Can Xnee record more than one display?'
     No, but we are considering adding the functionality (see the TODO
     file)

`Where is the CVS repository?'
     You can find a CVS tree at `http://savannah.gnu.org'.   You are
     more than welcome to join

`Is there a GUI frontend for Xnee ?'
     Yes! Gnee.

`What license is Xnee released under ?'
     GPL. Which can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html'

`Why the name Xnee?'
     We wanted to use a recursive acronym, as GNU ("GNU's Not Unix').
     After having read the Wine documentation, we thought that Xnee is
     not an Event Emulator would work fine since Xnee is Not an Event
     Emulator but rather a event recorder and faker.

`What does the name Gnee mean?'
     Gnee's not an Emulator Either

`What doesn't the name Gnee mean?'
     Gnee's not an Event Emulator

`Can you add xxx functionality to Xnee'
     Send an email to <xnee-devel@gnu.org> and we'll consider it.

`When starting Xnee I get noticed that I am missing RECORD extension'
     Your X server doesn't have the RECORD extension either loaded or
     compiled. To solve this you have to, depending on what Xserver you
     have do the following:

        * XFree86 4.0 and higher Make sure that the RECORD extension is
          loaded. This is done by letting the Module section in the X
          config file (e.g /etc/X11/XF86Config-4) look something like:

          `Section "Module"'
          `Load  "dbe"         # Double-buffering'
          `Load  "GLcore"      # OpenGL support'
          `Load  "dri"         # Direct rendering infrastructure'
          `Load  "glx"         # OpenGL X protocol interface'
          `Load  "extmod"      # Misc. required extensions'
          `Load  "v4l"         # Video4Linux'
          `# Load  "pex5"      # PHIGS for X 3D environment (obsolete)'
          `Load  "record"      # X event recorder'
          `# Load  "xie"       # X Image Extension (obsolete)'
          `# You only need the following two modules if you do not use
          xfs.'
          `# Load  "freetype"  # TrueType font handler'
          `# Load  "type1"     # Adobe Type 1 font handler'
          EndSection

          The important load directive (in this case) is the following
          line
          `Load  "record"  # X event recorder'
        * X.org, XFree86 (3.3 and lower)  or any other Xserver
          Recompile and reinstall the Xserver and make sure that RECORD
          extension is built into the Xserver. Please look at the
          documentation from your Xserver "vendor" on how to do that.

`How do I build VNC so that I can use Xnee together with it?'
     Download vnc source from:
     `http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/xvnchistory.html'
     In the file `Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def' change NO on the following
     items to YES as below:
     `#define BuildRECORD YES'
     `#define BuildRECORDlib YES'
     Download the Xfree86 distribution from `http://www.xfree86.org'.
     Specifically, the following dir, (currently in the file
     `X430src-3.tgz file' ):
     `tar zxvf \'
     `X430src-3.tgz '
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/Imakefile'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/record.c'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/recordmod.c'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/set.c'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/set.h'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/module/'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record/module/Imakefile'
     `cp -rf \'
     `xc/programs/Xserver/record \'
     `vnc_unixsrc/Xvnc/programs/Xserver'
     `cd libvncauth/' `xmkmf' `make all'
     `cd Xvnc' `make World |& tee LOG'
     Verify the build by running `xdpyinfo' in an xterm in the vncserver
     and verify that RECORD and XTEST extensions are loaded.

`How do I ensure that the mouse, during replay, is at the same position (x,y) as when recorded?'
     Use the `--store-mouse-pos' option.  This will cause Xnee to store
     the mouse position before starting to record. This position will
     be used to set the start position before replaying of recorded
     data starts.

`How do I ensure that the same window is focused as when recorded?'
     It's simple, just make sure that you record the window get focus.

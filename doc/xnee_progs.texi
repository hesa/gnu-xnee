@chapter Xnee Programs

@section cnee - cnee's not an event emulator

This is the command line program of the GNU Xnee suite. This programs
contains most features and is the basis for this documentation


@section gnee - gnee's not an emulator either

This is a GUI (using GTK2/Gnome) with most of the features of
cnee. The GUI has been designed for ease of use.

Currently there are no plans for making a separate manual for gnee.

@section pnee - pnee's not even emulating

This is a Gnome panel applet with a minimal set of features. Ease of
use is the motto for this program. By default pnee have settings that
need not be changed for most cases. You can, however, launch the
preferences dialog and set your preferred values as in most other
applets.

If you find pnee a bit limited we suggest you switch over to using
cnee.

@b{Note}: if pnee hangs you can press the stop button twice to make a
reset. Hopefully this will solve the problem.

@subsection Reporting pnee bugs
@cindex     Reporting pnee bugs

By default pnee writes error, verbose printouts and warnings to stderr
which will not be visible to you as a user, since pnee will be started
automatically along with the other applets. If you start up the
preferences dialog you can choose a file for pnee printouts. After
that you should turn on verbose logging (also in the preferences
dialog) and then reproduce the bug and send over the file to
@email{xnee-bug@@gnu.org}.

@chapter Xnee Programs

GNU Xnee consists of three different programs, cnee, gnee and pnee. 



@section cnee - cnee's not an event emulator

This is the Xnee command line program. This programs contains most
features and is the basis for this documentation.

For a user not used to X11 it is probably a good idea to start with
gnee or pnee instead or start using cnee in demonstration mode:
@code{cnee --demo}


@section gnee - gnee's not an emulator either

This is a GUI (using GTK2/Gnome) with most of the features of
cnee. The GUI has been designed for ease of use.

Currently there are no plans for making a separate manual for gnee.

@section pnee - pnee's not even emulating

This is a Gnome panel applet with a minimal set of features. Ease of
use is the motto for this program. It is intended for users not being
experts on X11 but still wants to record and replay a session for what
ever purpose. By default pnee have settings that need not be changed
for most cases. You can, however, launch the preferences dialog and
set your preferred values as in most other applets.

If you find pnee a bit limited we suggest you switch over to using
cnee.

@b{Note}: If pnee hangs you can press the stop button twice to make a
reset. Hopefully this will solve the problem.

@subsection Reporting pnee bugs
@cindex     Reporting pnee bugs

By default pnee writes error, verbose printouts and warnings to stderr
which will not be visible to you as a user, since pnee will be started
automatically along with the other applets. If you start up the
preferences dialog you can choose a file for pnee printouts. After
that you should turn on verbose logging (also in the preferences
dialog) and then reproduce the bug and send over the file to
@email{xnee-bug@@gnu.org}.

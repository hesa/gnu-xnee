@section Summary
  Xnee is a suite of programs that can record, replay and
  distribute user actions under the X11 environment. 
  Think of it as a robot that can imitate the job you just 
  did. 

Xnee consists of one library and two applications

  @b{cnee} - command line program

  @b{gnee} - graphical user interface program

  @b{pnee} - a Gnome Panel Applet

  @b{libxnee} - library used by xnee and gnee

            
            
@section Xnee features
@cindex features

Xnee can be used for multiple purposes, allthough it was initially designed as a test tool. The most used features are the foloowing:

@b{Test tool} - 
        Instead of performing test cases for a GUI (or CLI program) 
        over and over again, the test cases can be automated. Simply record 
        a user session and replay it later. 

@b{Performance test tool} - 
	If you want to simulate lots of simultaneous users in a network (or
	a local machine) you can use Xnee. Simply record a user
	session and start multiple instances of Xnee.

@b{Demonstration tool} - 
	You can use Xnee to demonstrate the features of your program. Simply 
	record a user session and replay it later. 

@b{Distribution tool} - 
	If you want to send over your mouse/keyboard actions to another display
	you can use the built-in distribution mechanism in Xnee. 

@b{Macro recorder/replayer} - 
	By binding a key and modifier combination (e.g using xrebind)
  to replay a recorded session you will have a Window Manager and 
  application independent macro.

@b{File retyper} - 
   Xnee can retype the contents of a file. This can be useful
   during tests or if you want xnee to answer some command
   session without having to record the session.


@section Background
@cindex background
In order to verify that a program does the job it's supposed to do, 
certain tests have to be made. 
These tests are, IMHO, perhaps the most boring things a programmer 
can do. Xnee is designed to reduce the programmer from this burden.
@*

Xnee started out as a commad line program. During the development
phase the main functionality was broken out to a library, called
libxnee. The command line program was renamed cnee. The thought behind 
making the library was to enable the writing of other clients than just 
the command line. Today there is a GUI program, gnee, that uses the library.

By using xnee your testcase(s) can be recorded and later on replayed.
Xnee comes with other features For more information about these, read the 
Introduction.

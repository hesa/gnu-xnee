The Xnee applications (gnee and xnee) receives X11 protocol data (e.g. events)
from an X server (using libxnee) and print them to a file, called Xnee 
Session File. Theses events are later read from the session file and replayed.
Gnee and xnee can read its settings from a file, called Xnee Project File, 
or from command line (cnee) or via the GUI (gnee).


@*
Events directly generated by the user (e.g KeyPress) can be replayed 
or faked. Requests, replies, errors and events not directly generated by the 
user (e.g MapNotify) can be recorded as well. By using these data  
Xnee can replay with synchronisation.

This directory contains files used to test libxnee and xnee applications.

Files to test cnee (Xnee's command line interface program) can be found
in cnee/test/.


It it assumed that you are familiar with Xnee .... so don't use these files
to get a feeling of Xnee.... it is used for testing puropses only.

BTW, the test application itself is just crap!!!!

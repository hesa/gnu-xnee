NOTE:
For Xnee developers on Linux:
 - I have tried to make the Makefile.am as independent as I could, but I could not get it to work on both RedHat GNU/Linux and Debian GNU/Linux. RedHat developers doesn't have to anything but Debian developers have to edit doc/Makefile.am. Use the Debian rules instead of the RedHat rules.....
